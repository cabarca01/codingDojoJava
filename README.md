example consisting of a simple class and a basic JUnit test and a basic *pom.xml* file. 

After cloning this project, execute `mvn clean test` to get all dependencies and run the unit tests. To
create the code coverage execute `mvn clean cobertura:cobertura`. The created report is stored in *target/site/cobertura*.
