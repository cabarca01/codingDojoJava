codingDojoJava
==============

This project can be used for coding dojo sessions for Java and Maven based katas. It contains a 
"Hello World!" example consisting of a simple class and a basic JUnit test and a basic *pom.xml* 
file. 

After cloning this project, execute `mvn clean test` to get all dependencies and run the unit 
tests.

**Please note:** The Maven plugin for Cobertura has been removed as it results in problems with 
Mavens *clean* goal on MacOS Java 1.6. A fix for this problem will be added later.


**HAPPY CODING :)**
